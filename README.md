# Characterization Tests in real life

This code is an old version of the [Apache Roller Project](https://roller.apache.org) source, ideally suited for exercising
[Characterization Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test).

## Exercises

The goal of the exercices is to enable testing and 100% coverage so that the behavior of the class is known and asserted
automatically with Unit Tests. This will enable, and provide a safety net for, extending and refactoring code that does not have
unit tests at all.
